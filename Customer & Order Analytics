-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#2 How many of those orders were placed for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';


#3 Find the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales febsales
ON customers.order_id = febsales.orderID
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#4 Which product was the cheapest sold January and what was the price?
SELECT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;


#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, ROUND(sum(quantity)*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


#6 Which products were sold in Fabruary at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101? How many of each were sold? What was the total revenue?

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in Febrary? What was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
